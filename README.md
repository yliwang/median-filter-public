Implementation of an image median filter.
For image borders, the padding process discussed in the class can be used.
for finding median from a numpy array, two options exist:
1. use median() function provided by module statistics
2. use median() function provided by numpy
a noisy image noisyLena.bmp is provided for testing one's implementation.
a prototype code named medianfilter.py is also provided, code for function MedianFilter should be added. 
code can be added to the main() function and/or following if __name__=='__main__' line to test your implementation.
